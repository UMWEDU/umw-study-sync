  UMW’s Master of Science in Geospatial Analysis (MSGA) allows students to earn two degrees in five years through our accelerated program, or to earn a master’s degree in a stand-alone program. Students interested in the MSGA should have taken undergraduate certificate in Geographic Information Science (GISC) courses or should have professional experience in this field.
  
  Geospatial technologies include modeling and geospatial analysis, remote sensing, geo-intelligence, and Python programming. The applications of geospatial technologies are exploding and are in particular demand in the greater Washington, D.C., region. In the MSGA program, students will integrate theory with critical thinking, project management, and communication skills while mastering geospatial techniques.
  
  This is an evening program for working professionals: All classes meet once a week from 6 to 9:30 p.m. on the Fredericksburg campus. Most students attend part time, taking one or two courses per semester. It is possible to complete the program in 12 months if one starts in the fall.
wpcf-areas-of-study: 'The MSGA requires students to take courses in <em>Spatial Thinking</em>, <em>Spatial Statistics</em>, and <em>GIS Programming</em>. The latter may be replaced with <em>Web Programming</em> if a similar class was previously taken. Electives include <em>Remote Sensing</em>, <em>GeoIntelligence</em>, and <em>Geovisualization</em>. Students complete independent capstone projects with a small committee in a variety of subject areas.'
wpcf-major-requirements: >
  Undergraduates interested in this 4+1
  program should take courses in
  Geographic Information Science and
  attend an information session in their
  junior year. Admitted students take two
  master’s degree-level courses in their
  senior year, which count toward both
  undergraduate and graduate degrees. They
  may then complete the MS degree in the
  following year. MSGA students take six
  4-credit courses and complete a 6-credit
  capstone project. Full details are
  available at the department website.

## Areas of Study
The MSGA requires students to take courses in *Spatial Thinking*, *Spatial Statistics*, and *GIS Programming*. The latter may be replaced with *Web Programming* if a similar class was previously taken. Electives include *Remote Sensing*, *GeoIntelligence*, and *Geovisualization*. Students complete independent capstone projects with a small committee in a variety of subject areas.
