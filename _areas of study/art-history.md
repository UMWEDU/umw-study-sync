  <div class="quote">I wouldn’t trade my experience at UMW for anything. Majoring in art history at Mary Washington was one of the best decisions I’ve made since it was a stepping stone to where I am today. I continue to rely on the courses I took and skills I acquired (especially writing!). I strongly believe majoring in art history made me a more competitive candidate for graduate school, since I bring a different background to the table.</div>
