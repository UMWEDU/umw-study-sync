  Earth’s climate is constantly
  changing. If you are curious about how
  extreme those changes have been, how we
  know what the climate was like millions
  of years ago, and how we understand the
  atmospheric processes that cause weather
  and climate, the climate science minor
  is a good place to start.
wpcf-areas-of-study: >
  The UMW climate science minor is
  interdisciplinary, including courses
  from the departments of biology,
  chemistry, earth and environmental
  science, geography, and physics. It is
  also flexible – you can combine
  classes to fit your interests, skills,
  and goals. This minor is housed in the
  Department of Geography.
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  An undergraduate minor in climate
  science is good preparation for graduate
  study in a variety of disciplines. It is
  also suitable for careers in planning
  and environmental consulting. For
  students interested in how the past has
  influenced modern landscapes and
  organisms, and for those who want to be
  more involved in conversations about
  climate change, this minor is for you.
wpcf-internships: >
  University of Mary Washington’s
  proximity to Washington, D.C., gives
  students access to internships with
  federal agencies, local governments,
  private industry, and nonprofit
  organizations.
wpcf-minor-requirements: >
  The climate science minor requires 16 to
  18 credits from among geography,
  environmental science, biology, and
  physics classes. Required courses
  include the subjects of weather and
  climate, dynamic climatology, and
  climate change.
