wpcf-value-proposition: >
  If you are interested in business and
  foreign cultures this may be the major
  for you. An international business major
  from University of Mary Washington may
  pursue traditional business careers or
  craft a major that’s less predictable.
  For example, if you study international
  business and minor in art, you might
  manage an art museum or deal in art.
wpcf-areas-of-study: >
  As an international business student,
  you will graduate with a solid business
  education, but you also must be able to
  understand the importance and influence
  of culture on how people make decisions.
  The international business major is one
  of four majors offered within the UMW
  College of Business that lead to the
  bachelor of science degree in business
  administration. All business majors are
  multi-disciplinary degrees that require
  students to master concepts from across
  the business disciplines, which include
  accounting, business administration,
  business law, decision sciences,
  finance, management, and management and
  information systems.
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  A major in international business will
  help prepare you for jobs with
  multinational firms, domestic firms that
  import or export goods and services,
  public institutions such as the federal
  government and its myriad agencies,
  international charitable agencies, and
  environmental organizations.  By
  carefully selecting course electives and
  experiences, you may find international
  careers in a host of fields, including
  traditional business paths (accounting,
  finance, logistics, management, MIS,
  marketing, and purchasing) or unique
  professions determined by your personal
  desires.
wpcf-internships: >
  At UMW, you’ll find internship
  opportunities close to campus and in
  nearby Washington, D.C., and Richmond,
  Virginia. Intern positions include real
  estate, social media, advertising,
  marketing research and brand
  development, Chamber of Commerce
  communications, financial planning, and
  automotive business operations.
wpcf-honors: "To be eligible for honors in international, you must have a 3.25 grade-point average in upper-division business administration courses and a 3.0 GPA overall. You'll do a research project, write a thesis, and defend it before a faculty honors committee."
wpcf-major-requirements: |
  All business majors share a common core of 30 hours of business classes from accounting, business administration, business law, decision sciences, finance, management, management and information systems, and marketing. International business majors take an additional 18 credits in upper-level international business electives.
  
  International business includes a semester abroad in marketing or business administration. International business majors also may benefit from upper-level classes in geography, economics, history, and political science.
wpcf-scholarships: 'Many <a href="http://business.umw.edu/current-students/undergraduate-scholarships/">scholarships</a> are available for business majors.'
