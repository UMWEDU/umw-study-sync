  Love crunching numbers? Open to all
  majors, UMW’s minor program in
  actuarial science develops skills
  expected of entry-level actuaries and
  prepares you for your first two
  actuarial exams, typically enough to
  land work while you advance toward
  future exams required for certification.
  Learn to compute rates, premiums, and
  dividends, and anticipate and manage
  probabilities and risk. You could see
  your career opportunities multiply!
wpcf-areas-of-study: >
  Open to all majors, the UMW minor in
  actuarial science includes courses in
  the disciplines of math, economics,
  accounting, and computer science for a
  full range of knowledge in rates, risks,
  probabilities, and statistical analysis.
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  Consistently ranked as a top career
  choice, actuarial science can lead to
  exceptional earning potential. Actuaries
  most typically work in insurance, with
  pensions, or in consulting firms, but
  they also can find work with financial
  services industries, marketing/sales
  organizations, benefits management
  firms, and other types of businesses.
  The U.S. Department of Labor expects
  employment opportunities for actuaries
  to increase faster than average.
