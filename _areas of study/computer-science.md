  Want to write cutting-edge software?
  Code the next killer app? Computer
  scientists find innovative solutions to
  complex problems. Our bachelor’s
  program combines theory, application,
  technique, and design. Explore computer
  architecture, multi-threaded
  programming, and software engineering,
  and choose from electives in networks,
  3D graphics, computer security, and
  more.
wpcf-areas-of-study: 'The bachelor’s program in computer science offers an <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/computerscience/course-offerings/">array of courses</a>, including problem solving with databases, digital storytelling, computer ethics, theoretical foundations of computing, Web application development, artificial intelligence, data mining, software engineering, and more.'
wpcf-career-opportunties: '<p class="p1"><i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> ranks jobs in computing among the best in the country. A bachelor’s degree in computer science will prepare you for a career as a software developer, database administrator, computer hardware engineer, database administrator, systems analyst, network architect, Web developer, security analyst, computer programmer, and more.</p>'
wpcf-internships: '<p class="p1">Internships allow qualified students to earn academic credit, gain real-world experience, and boost their resumes by working at technical firms, government offices, or software development agencies.
