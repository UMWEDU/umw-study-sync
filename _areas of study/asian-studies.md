  The University of Mary Washington was
  one of the first U.S. institutions of
  higher education to establish philosophy
  courses in Asian thought. Our minor in
  Asian studies prepares grads for success
  in an increasingly global economy –
  and world – where Asia and the Pacific
  play a robust role. This
  interdisciplinary program explores
  language, literature, history, society,
  politics, and more. Take advantage of
  UMW’s Leidecker Center for Asian
  Studies, which promotes academic and
  cultural exchange, as well as a summer
  field study in Thailand and an exchange
  program in Hong Kong.
wpcf-areas-of-study: >
  The Asian studies minor at UMW explores
  Asian art, civilization, and geography.
  Along with Chinese, study schools of
  thought such as Hinduism and Buddhism.
  Choose from courses in Asian American
  literature, the history of Japan and
  China, and the politics of East and
  South Asia.
