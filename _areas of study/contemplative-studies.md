wpcf-value-proposition: >
  When you minor in contemplative studies
  at the University of Mary Washington,
  you and your professors not only study
  contemplation from many disciplines and
  traditions but develop skill in
  mindfulness meditation practice itself.
  You’ll study its theory, science, and
  history and also practice
  self-reflection in a peer-supported,
  non-religious environment.
wpcf-areas-of-study: |
  This minor offers students a foundation in:
  <ol>
  <li>the theory of contemplation across traditions and history</li>
  <li>the application of contemplation in human life, including philosophy, religion, art, and performance</li>
  <li>the scientific study of meditation, its cutting-edge technologies, and the data gathered to document its effects on the brain and well-being</li>
  <li>significant practical training and experience in secular meditative techniques to develop skills such as concentration and empathy and reduce qualities such as stress and self-critique.</li>
  </ol>
wpcf-career-opportunties: 'Mindfulness training is currently being employed to enhance wellness and productivity in most industries: finance, tech, K-12 education, clinical psychology, medicine, and others. There is high-demand for workers with specialized mindfulness training, and especially those who are trained to teach it.'
wpcf-minor-requirements: >
  The Contemplative Studies Minor requires
  18 credits. They will come from a choice
  of classes in contemplative practice,
  psychology, philosophy, religion, art
  history, biology, classics, geography,
  and anthropology.
wpcf-scholarships: 'There are no scholarships specifically for contemplative studies. Here is a link to all <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/clpr/undergraduate-scholarships-and-awards/">scholarships in Classics, Philosophy, &amp; Religion</a>.'
