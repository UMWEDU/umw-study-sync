  When you minor in contemplative studies
  at the University of Mary Washington,
  you and your professors not only study
  contemplation from many disciplines and
  traditions but develop skill in
  mindfulness meditation practice itself.
  You’ll study its theory, science, and
  history and also practice
  self-reflection in a peer-supported,
  non-religious environment.
wpcf-areas-of-study: |

  <ol>
  <li>the theory of contemplation across traditions and history</li>
  <li>the application of contemplation in human life, including philosophy, religion, art, and performance</li>
  <li>the scientific study of meditation, its cutting-edge technologies, and the data gathered to document its effects on the brain and well-being</li>
  <li>significant practical training and experience in secular meditative techniques to develop skills such as concentration and empathy and reduce qualities such as stress and self-critique.</li>
  </ol>
