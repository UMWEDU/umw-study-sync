  This major provides discipline-specific
  knowledge required for students to
  pursue graduate programs in the health
  sciences. It provides a thorough
  foundation in biology’s fundamental
  principles including organism function,
  cell biology, genetics, physiology, and
  the research process. Command of these
  core concepts is necessary for students
  to understand complex biological
  problems and to apply their knowledge to
  health-related problems. Four
  health-related natural science electives
  are required so that students can
  develop a strong understanding of the
  basis of human health. Additionally,
  students must choose one course on
  societal perspectives on health that
  will expose them to a variety of health
  care concerns and provide a framework to
  understand and have empathy for their
  patients.
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  The Biomedical Sciences major is
  designed for students pursuing a career
  in the any of the many health
  professions. The major provides students
  with the knowledge and the skills to be
  successful candidates for graduate study
  in a broad range of health-related
  fields including medicine, dentistry,
  veterinary medicine, physician
  assistant, physical therapy, or any of
  the many health sciences careers.

  UMW biomedical sciences majors may
  qualify for paid internships through the
  Commonwealth STEM Industry Internship
  Program. The Department of Biology helps
  students learn about and apply for
  internships in the fields of research,
  medicine, zoology, botany, and ecology.
  Students also may find internships with
  museums in the Fredericksburg area or in
  nearby Richmond, Virginia, and
  Washington, D.C.
wpcf-honors: >
  To receive honors in biomedical
  sciences, you must have a 3.0
  grade-point average overall and 3.25 in
  the major. You’ll complete a research
  project, write an honors thesis, and
  deliver an oral presentation to
  department faculty.
