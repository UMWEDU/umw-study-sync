  state-of-the-art labs, research
  opportunities, and partnerships with
  regional veterinarians who welcome
  students as volunteers and interns.

wpcf-testimonial: |
  “The biology program at UMW was the perfect stepping-stone on my way to veterinary school. The professors and other faculty were so encouraging to me and my peers, and having small classes where I could know them personally made that relationship all the more meaningful. I got a solid education and felt very prepared for my entrance into a professional school.”
