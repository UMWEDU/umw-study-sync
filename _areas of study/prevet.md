  If you’re passionate about animals and
  their welfare, our program in
  pre-veterinary medicine may be just what
  you are looking for. UMW’s experienced
  advisors will help you plan your
  courses; they know what veterinary
  schools want in prospective students. We
  have an active pre-veterinary club,
  state-of-the-art labs, research
  opportunities, and partnerships with
  regional veterinarians who welcome
  students as volunteers and interns.
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  Follow UMW’s pre-vet alumni to top
  schools to become a veterinarian, or
  build a career in education, wildlife
  conservation, and other related fields.
wpcf-internships: >
  Veterinarians in the Fredericksburg area
  provide internship and volunteer
  opportunities to UMW students. In
  addition there are out-of-state
  internships available, including many
  offered across the U.S. through the
  Rochester Institute of Technology.
wpcf-honors: >
  Students may pursue honors in their
  major course of study. To receive honors
  in biology you must have a 3.0
  grade-point average overall and 3.25 in
  the major. You’ll complete a research
  project, write an honors thesis, and
  deliver an oral presentation to
  department faculty.
wpcf-major-requirements: 'Most pre-vet students pursue a <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/biology/">biology degree</a>, but other degrees majors work, too. Most veterinary schools require a rounded undergraduate curriculum including classes in English, biology, chemistry, biochemistry, physics, math, and humanities.'
wpcf-scholarships: 'The Department of Biology presents several <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/biology/awards-scholarships/">scholarships and awards</a> annually to outstanding biology majors.'
wpcf-testimonial: |
  “The biology program at UMW was the perfect stepping-stone on my way to veterinary school. The professors and other faculty were so encouraging to me and my peers, and having small classes where I could know them personally made that relationship all the more meaningful. I got a solid education and felt very prepared for my entrance into a professional school.”
  
  – Alexis Pennings ’14, student, Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine
