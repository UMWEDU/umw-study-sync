  Our bachelor’s program in sociology
  unravels some of the mysteries of human
  relationships. What causes us to behave
  the way we do? Where do our values come
  from? What fuels peer pressure? How do
  we develop our attitudes toward others?
  What affects family life? If you’ve
  often pondered questions like these,
  sociology may be the major for you.
wpcf-areas-of-study: >
  At UMW, you’ll get a strong foundation
  in sociological theory and research
  methods through the study of
  socialization, culture, social
  organization, social change,
  differentiation, and inequality. Courses
  focus on such topics as ethnic and
  racial relations, family, gender,
  medicine, occupations and professions,
  organizations, politics and the state,
  popular culture, population, religion,
  urban life, aging, juvenile delinquency,
  and criminology.
