wpcf-value-proposition: "Paired with a biology - or any other - major, UMW's pre-dental program helps you break into a lauded and often lucrative field, whether you plan to work in private practice, research, or academics. The program combines a solid core of biological science with pertinent subjects like chemistry and physics. Our partner clinics and volunteer opportunities provide the hands-on experience dental schools look for. Master teachers guide you through the complex application process with interview practice, recommendations and more."
wpcf-areas-of-study: "UMW students on the pre-dental track must also choose a major - most often it's biology, but students can target specific career goals with any of UMW's more than 40 majors. Pair courses in chemistry and physics with a core of biological sciences, including cellular, micro, and developmental biology, plus physiology, anatomy, histology, genetics, and immunology. With UMW's liberal arts and sciences curriculum you'll also strengthen your knowledge in English and math, and choose from a rich array of electives."
