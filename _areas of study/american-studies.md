wpcf-testimonial: |
  <p class="p1">My turning point toward pursuing a Ph.D. in history was taking a course on the History of Gilded Age America with Professor Ferrell. My assumptions that few significant developments occurred in the United States from 1865 to 1900 were quickly destroyed. I found myself captivated by a period of history that witnessed tremendous social unrest, anxiety, violence, and economic and demographic transformations.... I carried those questions with me to the Johns Hopkins University, where I completed a dissertation on the early-20th-century birth of the international wildlife protection movement and its hidden relationships with global capitalism, imperialism, smuggling, and species extinction—a dissertation that really began in the classrooms of Monroe Hall years earlier.</p>
