wpcf-value-proposition: "Our bachelor's program in chemistry takes you beyond beakers and test tubes, deep into a discipline that touches every aspect of our lives. Core courses in organic, analytical, and physical chemistry spark important connections between physics and math, biology and medicine. Hands-on opportunities and research in our-state-of-the-art labs put you in a position to make breakthroughs that matter."
wpcf-areas-of-study: "UMW's bachelor's program in chemistry covers societal, organic, physical, and environmental chemistry, and offers courses in biochemistry, chemical analysis, chemical outreach, and more."
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  A chemistry degree from UMW will prepare
  you for a career or advanced studies in
  environmental chemistry, chemical
  engineering, clinical chemistry,
  pharmaceutical chemistry, biomedical and
  forensic science, or technical sales.
  Our graduates have found careers at
  NASA, Dow, Virginia Power, Pfizer, the
