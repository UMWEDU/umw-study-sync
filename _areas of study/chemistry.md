wpcf-value-proposition: "Our bachelor's program in chemistry takes you beyond beakers and test tubes, deep into a discipline that touches every aspect of our lives. Core courses in organic, analytical, and physical chemistry spark important connections between physics and math, biology and medicine. Hands-on opportunities and research in our-state-of-the-art labs put you in a position to make breakthroughs that matter."
wpcf-areas-of-study: "UMW's bachelor's program in chemistry covers societal, organic, physical, and environmental chemistry, and offers courses in biochemistry, chemical analysis, chemical outreach, and more."
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  A chemistry degree from UMW will prepare
  you for a career or advanced studies in
  environmental chemistry, chemical
  engineering, clinical chemistry,
  pharmaceutical chemistry, biomedical and
  forensic science, or technical sales.
  Our graduates have found careers at
  NASA, Dow, Virginia Power, Pfizer, the
  Naval Research Laboratory, Atlantic
  Research, Estee Lauder, the Drug
  Enforcement Agency, the Naval Surface
  Warfare Center, and the National
  Institutes of Health.
wpcf-internships: 'Students are encouraged to pursue research and internship opportunities with such employers as the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the American Chemical Society.  Learn more about UMW <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/chemistry/research-opportunities/internships/">internships in chemistry</a>.'
wpcf-honors: "To earn honors in chemistry, you must have at least a 3.25 grade-point average in chemistry and 3.0 overall. You'll complete an independent research project, then write and defend a thesis. Students accepted for the honors program enroll in Chemistry 491 for four credits in each semester of the senior year."
wpcf-minor-requirements: 'A <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/courses-of-study/minors/chem/">minor in chemistry</a> requires at least 15 credits, including general chemistry with a lab, either organic chemistry or chemical analysis, each with a lab, and three more courses, to include no more than one lab, chosen from biochemistry, environmental chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and physical chemistry.'
wpcf-major-requirements: '<a href="http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/courses-of-study/majors/chem/">Chemistry majors</a> must complete 39 credits, including 19 upper-level courses. Students may complete extra coursework to earn an American Chemical Society-certified degree.'
wpcf-scholarships: 'Numerous <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/chemistry/scholarships-and-awards/">scholarships and awards</a> are available for chemistry majors.'
