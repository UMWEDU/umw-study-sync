wpcf-value-proposition: "Doctors make a difference. Our pre-medical program walks you through the steps it takes to become a physician, dentist, or other medical specialist. Rigorous academics - in your chosen bachelor's program; required courses like biology, physics, and math; and extras like genetics and history - mirror the challenges of med school. Passionate professors, clinical experience at the region's largest hospital, research, and community service will help you ace the MCAT and slide into med school."
wpcf-areas-of-study: "UMW's pre-medical program includes course and clinical requirements, elective extracurricular activities, and optional research work. Students must choose a discipline in which to major and fulfill its requirements along with pre-med requirements, including courses in biology concepts, phage hunters, general and organic chemistry, biochemistry, physics, English composition, math (calculus and statistics are recommended), sociology, and psychology. Cell biology, genetics, histology, and anatomy are also recommended in preparation for the MCAT. Pre-med students must acquire, as well, a minimum of 100 hours of clinical experience at a licensed medical practice or hospital."
wpcf-career-opportunties: "UMW's pre-medical program prepares students for the MCAT and for medical schools, as well as graduate school in specialized areas, like veterinary or sports medicine. Most pre-med UMW grads go on to study at Virginia medical schools, such as VCU and Eastern Virginia School of Medicine. Depending on your chosen major, post-graduation career opportunities may include research assistant, biology teacher, clinical lab technologist, mechanical engineer, and patient services representative. Terminal professional programs are also available in allied health care, including nuclear medicine technology, physician's assistant training, informatics, and medicinal dosimetry."
