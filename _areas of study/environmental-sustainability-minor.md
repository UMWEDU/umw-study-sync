  With businesses blamed for damaging rain
  forests and overfishing oceans,
  sustainability is a hot topic. UMW’s
  minor program explores environmental
  sustainability – making responsible
  decisions to reduce negative impact and
  ensure support of future human life –
  through environmental, social, economic,
  and cultural lenses. Examine society’s
  relationship with nature. Analyze
  methods of resolving resource issues.
  Typically attracting students from the
  natural and social sciences, philosophy,
  economics, and business, the
  environmental sustainability minor is
  open to all students and adaptable to
  individual interests and career goals.
wpcf-areas-of-study: "UMW's minor in environmental sustainability typically attracts students from the natural and social sciences, philosophy, economics, and business, but the program is open to all majors.

  government, education, and advocacy
  organizations for people trained in the

  and parks and recreation. Many find work
  with government organizations like the
  Environmental Protection Agency and the
  U.S Forest Service, private sector
  businesses like Seventh Generation and
  Whole Foods, and nonprofits like the
  Wilderness Society and Greenpeace.
