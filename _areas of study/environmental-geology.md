UMW's bachelor's program in environmental geology arms you with the knowledge and principles you need to understand Earth's evolution and processes. Discover how these fundamentals relate to human interaction with the landscape. Examine such topics as hydrogeology, soil and water chemistry, and geomorphology. Discover ways to curb the hazards that threaten our planet."
wpcf-areas-of-study: "UMW's bachelor's program in environmental geology includes courses in soil and water chemistry, geography, environmental science, and geographic information science. Geology courses from which to choose include Evolution of the Earth, Mineralogy, Sedimentation and Stratigraphy, Hydrogeology, and Icehouse-Greenhouse Earth. Independent research is highly recommended."
wpcf-career-opportunties: "Thanks to plentiful opportunities for independent study, research, and internships, and the state-of-the-art facilities available in UMW's Jepson Science Center, students who earn their degrees in environmental geology from UMW are poised to find work in environmental consulting, government, teaching, and several other fields. Many go on to graduate study at highly competitive universities."
wpcf-internships: 'Our students land internships with private industry, government agencies, and NGOs. Recent UMW geology students have held internships with the City of Fredericksburg, Army Corps of Engineers, National Resources Conservation Services, Virginia Game and Inland Fisheries, Friends of the Rappahannock, and the Chesapeake Climate Action Network.
