wpcf-value-proposition: "UMW's environmental science - social science major explores the effects humans have on the natural world, from the nearby Rappahannock River to the planet's most threatened ecosystems. Our interdisciplinary program encourages undergraduate research and gives you the knowledge and problem-solving skills to make a difference right away as a working scientist."
wpcf-areas-of-study: |
  The social sciences major starts with a firm foundation in chemistry, biology, and geology. Then you'll select from environmental science, geography, political science, economics, and sociology classes to create a <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/ees/environmental-science-program/social-environmental-science/">course of study</a> that meets your interests and career goals.
wpcf-career-opportunties: 'Recent UMW environmental sciences graduates have <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/ees/our-graduates/">gone to work</a> for the U.S. Geological Survey, the Peace Corps, the Department of State, state and local governments, and nongovernmental organizations. Many pursue advanced degrees.'

  can engage in rigorous honors-designated
  coursework, interdisciplinary seminars,
  internships, extended research and
  creative projects, and community
  service. Honors students often present
  at professional conferences and publish
