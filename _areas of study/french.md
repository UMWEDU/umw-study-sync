wpcf-value-proposition: "Maybe the French language is part of your heritage, or maybe you just loved the courses you took in high school. Now you're seeking mastery of the language, broad exposure to its rich literatures, and knowledge of  the French-speaking cultures. At UMW, you'll challenge yourself with compelling coursework, aided by our language labs and access to computer tutorials. In  conjunction with UMW's strong liberal arts program, you'll prepare yourself for a variety of international careers."
wpcf-areas-of-study: "UMW's French offerings include composition, phonetics and oral proficiency, a variety of French-language literatures, translation, senior seminars, business French, French cultures, and French cinema. You may spend a semester abroad, or learn intensively in spring and summer faculty-led trips to Paris, Provence, or Quebec."

  The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that the demand for interpreters and translators <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/media-and-communication/interpreters-and-translators.htm">will increase by more than 46 percent</a> between 2012 and 2022, making this field one of the fastest-growing occupations.

Some students have taken advantage of UMW's proximity to Washington, D.C., to intern with the Smithsonian Institution, the Library of Congress, and the French embassy.
wpcf-honors: |
  Students who have at least a 3.5 grade-point average in the French major and a 3.0 GPA overall by the beginning of senior year can apply to complete and defend a research-based thesis for <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/modernlanguages/departmental-honors/">departmental honors.</a>
