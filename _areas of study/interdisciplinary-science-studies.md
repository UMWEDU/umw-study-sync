wpcf-value-proposition: "If you have a calling to teach and a passion for the sciences, UMW's interdisciplinary science major will help you prepare for a career in science education. In combination with your education course work, you'll gain broad exposure to all the sciences and in-depth knowledge of a specific science field of your choice. You'll leave with a solid foundation to be an elementary science teacher or an educator for museums, nature centers, or zoos."
wpcf-areas-of-study: "Required introductory courses include environmental science, geology, global environmental problems, field methods, oceanography, energy resources and technology, quantitative reasoning, engineering and the design process, and a field project in STEM education. You'll also take UMW's popular and useful digital storytelling class."
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  As science, technology, engineering, and
  mathematics (STEM) education gains
  importance, schools, museums, and
  enrichment programs increasingly value
  knowledgeable teachers who can bring the
  sciences alive for young scholars.
wpcf-internships: >
  The College of Education keeps a list of
  local tutoring opportunities,
  internships, and paid positions for
  which students may qualify. In addition,
  UMW education students have
  opportunities for laboratory-based
  experiences, practicums, and teaching
  internships in local public schools.
wpcf-honors: >
  Students with high academic achievement
  are invited to become members of the Nu
  Xi Chapter of Kappa Delta Pi, an
  international honor society in
  education. Awards are given each year to
  students who excel in supervised
  teaching, academic achievement, and
  leadership.
wpcf-major-requirements: '<a href="http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/courses-of-study/majors/idis/">Interdisciplinary science studies majors</a> must earn 21 credits in Earth and environmental sciences and another 11 or 12 credits in their chosen science area such as biology, chemistry, physics, geology, or computer science. Also required are courses in mathematics, engineering and design, a STEM capstone project, and digital storytelling. Majors will complete education course work required for students enrolled in the five-year Master of Science in Elementary Education program.'
