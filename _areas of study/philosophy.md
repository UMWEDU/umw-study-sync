wpcf-value-proposition: 'Do you wrestle with the questions that seem to have no answers: What is truth? What is the nature of existence? What is free will? If so, philosophy – the love of wisdom, the science of argument – might be the major for you. Our bachelor’s program teaches you to think critically, communicate clearly, and be open to opposing views – rich skills for all fields.'
wpcf-areas-of-study: >
  Explore introductory logic and ethics,
  ancient Greek philosophy, and early
  modern philosophy. Then choose from
  additional courses covering medieval
  philosophy; social and political
  philosophy; aesthetics; feminism;
  existentialism; phenomenology;
  practical, medical, or environmental
  ethics; Hinduism, Buddhism, and Daoism;
  Asian and comparative philosophy;
  20th-century philosophy; Freud’s
  greatest hits; and in-depth examinations
  of Plato, Aristotle, Hume, Kant, Hegel,
  Marx, and Nietzsche.
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  Philosophy is great preparation for grad
  school, law school, seminary, or a
  career in business, consulting, or
  politics. UMW philosophy graduates have
  continued study in such disciplines as
  law, research, and teaching. Some have
  headed directly into business,
  journalism, publishing, and other
  professions that demand critical
  thinking and clear writing.
wpcf-internships: 'Undergraduates have opportunities to complete <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/clpr/undergraduate-research/">research</a> and present at conferences, making valuable contacts for the professional world.'
wpcf-honors: 'To graduate with <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/clpr/philosophy-program/honors-program/">honors</a> in philosophy, you must have at least a 3.5 grade-point average in the major. You’ll complete a research project and write and defend a senior thesis.'
wpcf-major-requirements: 'The <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/courses-of-study/majors/phil/">philosophy major</a> requires 30 credits from 10 courses including logic, ancient Greek philosophy, and early modern philosophy; a selection of courses from other philosophy disciplines; and two additional courses, including one at the 300 level or above.'
wpcf-scholarships: '<a href="http://cas.umw.edu/clpr/undergraduate-scholarships-and-awards/">Scholarships</a> are available for all disciplines in the Department of Classics, Religion, and Philosophy.'
