wpcf-value-proposition: "What do West African farmers and Wall Street investors have in common? Our bachelor's program in anthropology takes you around the globe and throughout history to learn what it means to be human. Explore morality, religion, and more and take advantage of our summer course in Guyana and opportunities for student research in places like Madagascar, Haiti, and Egypt."
wpcf-areas-of-study: "On your journey through UMW's Anthropology program, you'll take courses such as Introduction to Cultural and Social Anthropology, Ethnography, Arguments in Anthropology, Anthropology of Art, and Theories of Culture."
wpcf-career-opportunties: "The strong background in what it means to be human across the globe, and throughout time, and the experiential learning opportunities you'll gain in completing UMW's Anthropology program will prepare you for a variety of careers. Work in marketing, advertising, diversity training, social advocacy,  historic preservation, community development, communications, international development, genetics counseling, documentary film-making, government, education, you name it."
wpcf-internships: >
  Internship opportunities abound for UMW
  Anthropology majors. Snag a spot at the
  Micah Ecumenical Shelter, Thurman
  Brisben Homeless Shelter, or disAbility
  Resource Center. Or you could gather
  valuable professional experience at
  places like Empowerhouse, Refugee
  Resettlement Services, the Lloyd F. Moss
  Free Clinic, Rappahannock Legal
  Services, the Virginia Department of
  Juvenile Justice, Rappahannock Regional
  Jail, the Human Rights Campaign, the
  U.S. Census Bureau, and more.
wpcf-honors: |
  Departmental honors in anthropology is centered largely on an honors thesis written under the supervision of a committee chaired by the anthropology faculty member with the greatest expertise in the student's area of interest. During the candidate’s research, she or he must persuade the committee that the project is worthwhile, moving forward, and deserving of departmental honors.
  
  A successful honors thesis presents an original, informed, persuasive argument based on extensive, sound, imaginative scholarship; broad knowledge of the topic and understanding of the theoretical framework within which the candidate discusses the topic; and competent writing. An honors candidate should expect to work mostly independently, with minimal guidance from the advisor(s). Ideally, a successful honors project should be publishable in a minor anthropological journal.
wpcf-minor-requirements: "What is <em>happening</em> with all of these <strong>exports/syncs</strong>? Hopefully we'll eventually get the formatting right."
wpcf-major-requirements: 'The <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/courses-of-study/majors/anth/">anthropology major</a> requires 30 credit hours, including Introduction to Cultural Anthropology, Ethnography, Theories of Culture, Senior Research, and Senior Seminar, plus 15 credit hours of electives in anthropology, including at least one course that includes a significant field-research component.'
