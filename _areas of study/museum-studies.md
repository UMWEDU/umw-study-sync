wpcf-value-proposition: >
  A minor in museum studies gives you the
  hands-on practice and theory necessary
  to enter the growing field of museum
  careers. The minor explores not only how
  museums are organized and operated, but
  also how they care for and interpret
  their collections, serve their
  audiences, and respond to new
  technologies. You will look at how
  museums grapple with complex legal and
  ethical issues unique to their
  disciplines including the cultural
  implications of the work they do and the
  extent of that work’s impact from the
  intimate community to the global market.
wpcf-areas-of-study: >
  Combining theory with practice, the
  curriculum incorporates classroom study
  and directed research with practical
  experiences in the form of field trips,
  group projects, and internships. The
  minor incorporates the disciplines of
  American studies, anthropology, art and
  art history, classics, historic
  preservation, and history, from which
  students may select their own
  concentration preference. The minor is
  open to students from any discipline in
  the arts and sciences, education, or
  business colleges at UMW.
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  The museum field is a rapidly expanding
  and vital part of society. The American
  Alliance of Museums estimates there are
  17,500 museums operating in the United
  States alone, generating a demand for
  highly trained museum professionals.
wpcf-internships: >
  Museum studies students have the
  opportunity to collaborate with UMW
  alumni working in museums all over the
  United States. UMW interns have worked
  in such institutions as the Smithsonian
  National Museum of African American
  History and Culture, the National Museum
  of the Marine Corps, and the U. S.
  Holocaust Memorial Museum. UMW’s three
  museums also support this minor with
  internship opportunities.
wpcf-minor-requirements: 'The museum studies minor requires 18 credits. You must take two basic museum studies courses (6 credits) and complete an internship (3 credits) through one of the following departments: American studies, anthropology, art history, classics, historic preservation, or history. You will complete three elective courses (9 credits) from among the same departments, including such classes as the anthropology of art, archives and society, digital history, and introduction to conservation. Approved special topics courses may count as electives.'
wpcf-scholarships: 'While there are no UMW scholarships specifically for the museum studies minor, there are scholarships that may be available to museum studies minors. <a href="https://umw.scholarships.ngwebsolutions.com/CMXAdmin/Cmx_Content.aspx?cpId=886">Search scholarships</a>.'
wpcf-testimonial: |
  Michelle King ’14 completed an internship at the Archives Branch of the U. S. Holocaust Memorial Museum; Rebecca Erbelding ’03, archivist, was her contact and mentor.
  
  “My main responsibilities as a collections intern included handling artifacts, cataloging and organizing collections, scanning documents for future scholarly use, and attending meetings with donors. I applied my skills within two larger projects at the museum. The first was the making of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iIHqGjpzYg">video clip</a> on a letter donated to the museum by Charlotte Delbo, a French writer and member of the French resistance, who wrote this letter during her imprisonment at Auschwitz. The second project pertained to the processing of a large family collection of documents and artifacts, which I sorted, organized, scanned, cataloged, and created a finding aid for. I was assigned to do this work alone and accomplishing it gave me confidence in my abilities.
  
  I could not ask for more out of a summer-long internship. In addition to learning more about the history of the Holocaust and World War II, I gained a better understanding of the museum professions and the museum world in general. My internship coordinators and the museum staff encouraged me to ask questions and learn as much as I could. This internship confirmed that by declaring my minor in Museum Studies, I have chosen the perfect career path for me.”
