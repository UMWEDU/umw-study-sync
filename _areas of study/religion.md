wpcf-value-proposition: >
  Religions affect more than beliefs –
  they influence politics, shape culture,
  and create conflict and unity. At UMW,
  you will delve into the languages and
  beliefs that surround Christianity,
  Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and
  other religions to better understand how
  religious beliefs affect our lives.
wpcf-areas-of-study: "Study traditions, texts, and people to learn the historical and cultural impact of the world's major religions. This program doesn't ascribe to any particular belief system. Students work work one-on-one with faculty on research and a senior thesis and are encouraged to explore other disciplines – such as philosophy and anthropology – to help identify their special interests."
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  As a religious studies major, you will
  leave UMW with skills in critical
  thinking, persuasive writing, oral
  communication, and research. While some
  religious studies graduates pursue
  advanced degrees for careers in teaching
  and research, most develop careers in
  such diverse fields as public relations,
  journalism, business, teaching, service
  organizations, and the arts. The major
  is excellent preparation for studies in
  library science, law, social work, and
  the ministry.
wpcf-internships: >
  Supervised off-campus internships are
  available to qualified students and are
  developed in consultation with religious
  studies faculty.
wpcf-honors: 'To receive honors in religious studies, you will need at least a 3.5 grade-point average in the major and a grade of A in the capstone course required of all religious studies majors. In that course, you’ll choose a topic for research, then write a 20- to 25-page thesis and present it to your fellow students.'
wpcf-major-requirements: 'The <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/courses-of-study/majors/relg/">religious studies</a> requires 30 credits in approved core and elective courses. All religious studies majors must complete a capstone course, in which they’ll write and present a thesis. Some classics or philosophy courses may count toward the major.'
wpcf-scholarships: 'In addition to general scholarships awarded by the university, religious studies faculty award two <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/clpr/religion-program/honors-awards-scholarships/">scholarships</a> specific to the religious studies major.'
