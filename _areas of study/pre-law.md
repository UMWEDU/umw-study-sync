  Curious about a career in the courtroom?
  UMW pre-law grads go on to earn juris
  doctor degrees from top schools. A
  liberal arts and sciences curriculum in
  the UMW Department of Philosophy fosters
  the critical thinking and communication
  skills you’ll need. We offer
  challenging coursework in logic, ethics,
  and the legal system; mock trial and
  debate teams; law-firm internships; and
  services like LSAT study sessions,
  pre-law advising, and law school
  recommendations.
wpcf-areas-of-study: |
  Many students in UMW’s pre-law program choose to major in philosophy, but even if you decide to pair your pre-law studies with another of our majors – political science or psychology, for example – you’ll still study the philosophy of ancient Greece, the early modern era, law, ethics, logic, and more.
  
  In addition, UMW offers the “<a href="http://www.umw.edu/careercenter/students/graduate-school/umwgeorge-mason-33-program/">3+3 Accelerated Program</a>” with George Mason University. It allows highly motivated students a fast track to earn both a bachelor’s degree and a law degree in six, rather than seven, years of study.
