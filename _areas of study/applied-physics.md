  Are you filled with wonder about how the
  natural world works and want to be able
  to apply that knowledge? Are you
  interested in the mathematical
  underpinnings of fundamental physics but
  desire to take it to the next level with
  computer and data science? Are you
  looking to use your abilities to analyze
  complex problems, work with high-tech
  equipment and put into practice your
  strong quantitative background by
  preparing for in-demand careers? If you
  answered “yes” to these questions,
  then the practical approach of our
  applied physics program provides a
  seamless transition from your liberal
  arts education to industry and
  government labs.
wpcf-areas-of-study: >
  The applied physics major includes
  several core physics courses, such as
  university physics, modern physics,
  mathematical methods of physics, and
  several other. It also has a core
  requirement of three mathematics
  courses, including calculus I and II,
  and required courses in data science and
  computer science.
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  Applied physics majors are well-prepared
  for many different technical jobs such
  as design and analysis of optical,
  electronic, and acoustic systems;
  telecommunications; advanced programming
  for engineering modeling; and many more.
wpcf-internships: >
  The applied physics major requires
  students to participate in either
  independent study or an internship.
  For-credit and paid internships are
  available close to campus and in nearby
  Washington, D.C., and Richmond,
  Virginia. They provide opportunities for
  students to gain applied work experience
  and learn about potential employers.
  Internship sponsors such as NASA and the
  Naval Surface Warfare Center work with
  the department to establish individual
  objectives. Individual study with UMW
  professors is another avenue though
  which students conduct intensive study
  and develop advanced technical skills.
wpcf-honors: >
  Applied physics majors may earn
  departmental honors through a full-year
  research project conducted during the
  senior year. Your academic advisor can
  explain the detailed requirements and
  guide you through this process.
wpcf-major-requirements: 'The <a href="https://catalog.umw.edu/undergraduate/majors/applied-physics/#requirementstext">applied physics major</a> requires between 37 to 41 credits from courses in physics, data science, computer science, math, and a capstone physics course.'
