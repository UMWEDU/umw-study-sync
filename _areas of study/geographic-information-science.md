  The Geographic Information Science
  certificate at the University of Mary
  Washington addresses the growing demand
  for GIS-trained personnel in today’s
  working world. Built on a vision
  combining core theory with real-world
  applications to provide a
  state-of-the-art GIS educational
  experience, the certificate introduces
  students to a wide array of critical
  functions in ArcGIS.
wpcf-areas-of-study: >
  The field encompasses integrated
  hardware, software, and database systems
  that are capable of capturing, storing,
  analyzing, and displaying geographical
  information. Upon completion of the
  certificate, students may be eligible to
  apply for an additional professional
  certification in GIS administrated by
  the GIS Certification Institute (GISCI).
wpcf-major-requirements: 'The <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/courses-of-study/minors/geographic-information-science-certificate/">certificate</a> requires 19 credit hours of GIS course work introducing students to advanced spatial analysis, Python programming in ArcGIS, geodatabase design, spatial statistics and modeling, image analysis and more. The certificate can be obtained solely through evening classes.'
