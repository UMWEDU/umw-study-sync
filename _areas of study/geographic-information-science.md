  Geographic Information Science (GIS) is the study and practice of methods used to collect, store, manage, visualize, analyze, and present geographic data. Examples of the use of GIS include <strong>routing</strong> school buses or delivery trucks; <strong>locating</strong> a landfill, an airport, or a restaurant; <strong>predicting</strong> locations of greatest risk during a hurricane storm surge; and <strong>mapping</strong> the spread of the COVID-19 virus and analyzing how it spreads, where it is more prevalent, and what types of communities are most at risk.
  
  GIS is considered a high growth field by the Department of Labor and is in much demand in the region. Its study results in valuable skills that can be combined with almost any major – employers look for students with a broad liberal arts background combined with the in-depth technical skills provided by this certificate.
wpcf-areas-of-study: >
  The GIS Certificate can be taken with
  any major, but is most commonly combined
  with Geography, Geology, Environmental
  Science, Biology, Historic Preservation,
  Political Science, International
  Affairs, and Marketing. It is housed
  within the Department of Geography,
  where faculty specialize in spatial
  analysis, Python programming, remote
  sensing, spatial statistics, and
  geovisualization.
wpcf-major-requirements: 'The <a href="https://catalog.umw.edu/undergraduate/minors/geographic-information-science-certificate/#requirementstext">certificate</a> requires 19 credit hours of GIS course work, taken in four 4-credit courses and one 3-credit capstone. It may be taken by undergraduates just like a minor, or by professional non-degree-seeking students. <em>Introduction to GIS</em> and <em>Spatial Analysis</em> are required. Students take one elective, and they take either <em>GIS Programming</em> or <em>Web GIS</em>. The capstone is either an internship or a directed study. The certificate can be obtained solely through evening classes.'
