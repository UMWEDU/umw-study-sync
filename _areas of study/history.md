  <p class="p1">Explore world and American history in Fredericksburg, Virginia, a city with a long human story of its own. Here you can study pre-European cultures, the American Revolution, the Civil War, and the 20th century -- and that's just outside the classroom. UMW's master teachers will ground you in a broad knowledge of history and help you narrow your focus to gain specialized expertise.

  research class.
