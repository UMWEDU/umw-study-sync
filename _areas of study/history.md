  <p class="p1">Explore world and American history in Fredericksburg, Virginia, a city with a long human story of its own. Here you can study pre-European cultures, the American Revolution, the Civil War, and the 20th century -- and that's just outside the classroom. UMW's master teachers will ground you in a broad knowledge of history and help you narrow your focus to gain specialized expertise. You'll leave ready to make a difference in a career or graduate school.</p>
wpcf-areas-of-study: >
  The history curriculum offers courses
  from ancient to modern times in the
  Americas and around the world. The major

  critical judgment, including first-year
  seminars, history colloquium and
  practicum, and a senior-level historical
  research class.

UMW students have found internships with the Smithsonian Institution, the National Archives, the U.S. Marine Corps at Quantico, the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park, Mount Vernon, and regional museums.
wpcf-honors: |
