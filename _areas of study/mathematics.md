wpcf-value-proposition: "Major in mathematics at the University of Mary Washington and you'll expand your analytical and critical-thinking abilities. You'll work on original mathematics, present at professional meetings, and maybe even publish your work. You'll graduate ready to solve problems creatively in any professional field or in graduate school."
wpcf-areas-of-study: "You'll choose from courses in algebra, analysis, topology (modern geometry), discrete mathematics (mathematics of computer science), number theory, statistics, dynamical systems, stochastic partial differential equations (mathematical models), scientific computation (numerical analysis and simulation), and financial mathematics."
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  Career opportunities are plentiful for a
  mathematician trained in numerical
  techniques, modeling, applied analysis,
  and statistics. Mathematicians work in
  such diverse areas as physics,
  chemistry, space technology, economics,
  business management, statistical
  analysis, operations research, medical
  research, and environmental science.
  Because of a strong need for secondary
  math educators, prospects are excellent
  for a dedicated and well-trained
  mathematician interested in teaching.
wpcf-internships: >
  The Fredericksburg and Washington, D.C.,
  metropolitan areas offer many internship
  opportunities for undergraduate math
  majors. UMW students and mathematics
  graduates have found internships and
  full-time jobs with the Naval Surface
  Warfare Center in nearby Dahlgren,
  Virginia; Geico in Stafford County,
  Virginia; NASA; the U.S. Census Bureau;
  and the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
  among many other employers.
wpcf-honors: "As a mathematics major, you may graduate with honors. Requirements include a grade-point average of 3.5 in the major (3.0 overall) and two 400-level mathematics courses. Under the supervision of an advisor, you'll complete either a directed study or undergraduate research project. You'll write a thesis and present it to the mathematics department."
wpcf-minor-requirements: 'Students from any discipline may minor in mathematics.  The <a href="https://catalog.umw.edu/undergraduate/minors/mathematics/#requirementstext">mathematics minor</a> requires 18 mathematics credits. At least 12 credits must be earned from mathematics courses at the 300 level or above. Students can also minor in <a href="https://catalog.umw.edu/undergraduate/minors/applied-mathematics/#requirementstext">applied mathematics </a>or <a href="https://catalog.umw.edu/undergraduate/minors/actuarial-science/#requirementstext">actuarial science</a>.'
wpcf-major-requirements: 'The <a href="https://catalog.umw.edu/undergraduate/majors/mathematics/#requirementstext">mathematics major</a> requires 36 credits, of which 15 must come from specified courses in calculus, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, abstract algebra, and real analysis. Additional credits must be earned from 300- and 400-level classes. Mathematics electives or certain computer science, physics, and philosophy courses also may count toward the major.'
wpcf-scholarships: 'Several <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/math/student-opportunities/scholarships-awards-and-honor-societies/">scholarships and honor societies</a> are open to mathematics majors.'
