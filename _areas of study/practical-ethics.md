wpcf-value-proposition: "Ethics are key to understanding some of the most challenging and controversial social problems of the 21st century. In UMW's minor program in practical ethics, you'll explore the fundamental theories, concepts, and methodologies of ethics; ways of identifying and analyzing contemporary moral issues; and how theory and practice inform one another. How do you feel about reproductive technologies, euthanasia, the treatment of animals, sustainability? Question your own beliefs, and learn how reason and argument affect everyday ethical decision-making."
wpcf-areas-of-study: "UMW's practical ethics minor is wrapped around a core of philosophy courses, including practical, medical, and environmental ethics; social and political philosophy; and introduction to feminism. Participants must also choose classes from a variety of disciplines, including education, geography, and sociology. Courses include business and computer ethics, global environmental problems, medical sociology, and many more."
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  Able to identify ethical issues and
  evaluate ethical arguments, practical
  ethics minors catch the attention of
  employers and grad schools. A background
  in practical ethics can be useful in any
  field, particularly law, business,
  medicine, ecological and resource
  science, and government or community
  work.
wpcf-internships: 'Undergraduates have opportunities to <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/clpr/undergraduate-research">complete research</a> and present at conferences, making valuable contacts for the professional world.'
wpcf-honors: >
  Students with an overall GPA of at least
  3.2, and at least 3.5 in philosophy, are

  Research in Philosophy (PHIL 485) during
  their senior year, producing and
  defending a substantial written thesis.
wpcf-minor-requirements: "UMW's practical ethics minor requires at least 18 credit hours, including at least three philosophical ethics courses and at least three additional courses in a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, education, geography, religion, and sociology.
