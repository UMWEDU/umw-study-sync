wpcf-value-proposition: "Ethics are key to understanding some of the most challenging and controversial social problems of the 21st century. In UMW's minor program in practical ethics, you'll explore the fundamental theories, concepts, and methodologies of ethics; ways of identifying and analyzing contemporary moral issues; and how theory and practice inform one another. How do you feel about reproductive technologies, euthanasia, the treatment of animals, sustainability? Question your own beliefs, and learn how reason and argument affect everyday ethical decision-making."
wpcf-areas-of-study: "UMW's practical ethics minor is wrapped around a core of philosophy courses, including practical, medical, and environmental ethics; social and political philosophy; and introduction to feminism. Participants must also choose classes from a variety of disciplines, including education, geography, and sociology. Courses include business and computer ethics, global environmental problems, medical sociology, and many more."
wpcf-career-opportunties: >

  evaluate ethical arguments, practical

  science, and government or community
  work.

  3.2, and at least 3.5 in philosophy, are
