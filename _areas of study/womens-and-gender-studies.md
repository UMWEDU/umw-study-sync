  Everyone has a sex and everyone has a
  gender. Our bachelor’s degree in
  women’s and gender studies focuses on
  people’s experiences as women and men
  – and on masculinity and femininity
  – across time and around the world.
  You will choose and craft your courses
  from diverse fields and examine the
  complex interactions of gender, class,
  ethnicity, sexual orientation, and race.
wpcf-areas-of-study: >
  Our 33 affiliated faculty members with
  expertise in nine separate disciplines
  will introduce a breadth of gendered
  experiences. Professors in such fields
  as art, Spanish literature, history,
  political science, sociology, and
  psychology will support you as you
  identify your interests and craft your
  major. In the classroom, they will
  challenge your assumptions about our
  similarities and differences and lead
  you to reflect on the concerns that sex
  and gender create in society. You will
  design a capstone project with faculty
  guidance, and you may do up to two
  faculty-supervised independent studies.
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  Because you will craft your courses from
  across disciplines, you can leave
  prepared to pursue higher education or
  work in such fields as law, nonprofit
  advocacy, teaching, health care, social
  work, journalism, public relations, and
  more.
wpcf-internships: >
  Majors have completed internships at
  local agencies and national
  organizations. You will craft an
  internship that will reflect your area
  of interest and course concentration.
