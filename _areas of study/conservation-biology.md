wpcf-value-proposition: >
  Are you passionate about preserving the
  earth’s biological diversity and the
  ecosystems that depend on it? If so, a
  major in conservation biology may be
  right for you. From protecting
  endangered animals to restoring native
  plant communities, you can pursue your
  deepest interests through the
  conservation biology major. This program
  provides cross-disciplinary approaches
  and high-impact learning opportunities
  that will help you land a rewarding
  career that makes a positive difference.
wpcf-areas-of-study: >
  This major combines the strengths of
  biology, environmental science, and
  geography to prepare students for
  careers in conservation biology. Majors
  must complete core courses in ecology,
  biodiversity, genetics, research design,
  and biostatistics. They take one course
  in GIS and a non-science course
  addressing the ethical and political
  aspects of conservation.
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  The conservation biology track is
  designed for students interested in
  public or private-sector careers in
  fields such as endangered species
  protection and recovery, habitat
  conservation, conservation biology
  education, and fisheries and wildlife
  management. Additionally, it prepares
  students for graduate study in
  conservation biology, especially where
  graduate degrees are required for
  particular careers. Job opportunities
  are available with state and federal
  wildlife management agencies, local and
  international non-governmental
  conservation organizations, and zoos and
  other captive breeding facilities for
  critically endangered species.
wpcf-internships: >
  UMW anticipates a rich variety of
  internships for the new conservation
  biology major at such organizations as
  the Smithsonian Conservation Biology
  Institute, the Virginia Department of
  Game and Inland Fisheries, the United
  States Fish and Wildlife Service, and at
  Fredericksburg-area nonprofits such as
  Friends of the Rappahannock and the
  Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
wpcf-honors: 'Conservation biology majors are eligible to pursue the <a href="https://academics.umw.edu/honorsprogram/">University Honors Program</a> and the <a href="https://cas.umw.edu/biology/biology-honors-program/">Biology Honors Program</a>.'
