wpcf-value-proposition: >
  Are you drawn to the chemistry of life?
  Biochemistry studies life on the
  molecular and atomic levels – deep
  inside of each living organism at its
  most basic components. It encompasses
  not only the structures of the chemical
  components of living matter, but also
  the metabolism of living matter and
  molecular genetics. If you find that
  interesting, this might be the major for
  you.
wpcf-areas-of-study: >
  In the UMW biochemistry major, which you
  will pursue through the Department of
  Chemistry, you’ll take chemistry,
  biology, and physics as well as
  biochemistry lectures and labs. If you
  choose, there are electives in nutrition
  and metabolism, the biology of cancer,
  biochemistry of proteins, and more.
wpcf-career-opportunties: >
  A biochemistry degree is great
  preparation for careers in dentistry,
  medicine, veterinary medicine,
  nutrition, and more. For some, it leads
  to entry-level careers in medicine,
  agriculture and the environment. Because
  of the transferable and highly
  employable skills you develop during
  your studies, you have the choice to
  pursue a variety of careers outside of
  science as well.
wpcf-internships: 'Students are encouraged to pursue research and internship opportunities with such employers as the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the American Chemical Society.  Learn more about UMW <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/chemistry/research-opportunities/internships/">internships in chemistry</a>, some of which are specific to biochemistry.'
wpcf-honors: >
  Pursuing graduation with honors in
  biochemistry requires a 3.25 grade-point
  average in your chemistry courses and a
  3.0 overall GPA. You’ll complete an
  independent research project, then write
  and defend a thesis. Students accepted
  for the honors program enroll in
  Chemistry 491 for four credits in each
  semester of the senior year.
wpcf-major-requirements: >
  To receive a bachelor of science degree
  in biochemistry, you must earn 48
  credits from the disciplines of biology
  and chemistry. You will also need to
  complete the introductory physics
  sequence and calculus I and II. You may
  choose electives tailored to your
  interests, such as nutrition, cancer
  research, or others to prepare you for
  future endeavors.
wpcf-scholarships: >
  Each year, the department awards two UMW
  Foundation research-focused scholarships
  (Mahoney and Rodgers fellowships) and
  two more general scholarships (Cook and
  Crissman scholarships). These are
  awarded annually on the basis of merit
  and, in some cases, financial need. In
  addition, there are three other
  scholarships that the department offers
  on a rotating basis with the other
  science departments (Cope, Gill, and
  Rimnac scholarships).
wpcf-testimonial: >
  I just feel like that’s the place
  where I can help the most people, people
  who are facing extremely slim odds of
  making it through their illnesses,”
  Matt Tovar ’18 said of his planned
  work as a neurosurgeon. “I feel
  that’s my calling."
