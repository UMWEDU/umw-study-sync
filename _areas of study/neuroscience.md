wpcf-value-proposition: "Do you like to think about how people think? UMW's interdisciplinary minor program in neuroscience deepens your understanding of the brain and nervous system. Learn how nerves form networks and how these connections control behavior. Explore stress, memory, psychiatric disorders, and all the varied mysteries surrounding the human mind. The neuroscience minor is particularly useful to psychology and biology majors, helping them stay aware of scientific progress and prepare for emerging career opportunities and graduate programs in neuroscience or psychobiology."
wpcf-areas-of-study: "UMW's minor program in neuroscience, pairing the studies of biology and psychology, explores the intricacies of the brain and nervous system and how they work together to control behavior. The program consists for course in cellular biology, neurobiology, cognitive neuroscience, biological psychology, and psychopharmacology."
wpcf-career-opportunties: "The neuroscience minor is a good fit for those interested in a psychiatric healthcare career, especially psychiatry, pharmachology, psychiatric-mental health nursing, clinical psychology, or cognitive rehabilitation. Advances in neural imaging technology, molecular genetics, and bioinformatics - along with growing interest in psychiatric disorders, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, and Alzheimer's - is creating growing demand for professionals trained in neuroscience. The study of neuroscience, even without an advanced degree, can lead to a career in pharmaceuticals, health education, forensic science, residential counseling, and many other exciting fields."
