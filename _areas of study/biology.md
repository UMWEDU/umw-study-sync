wpcf-value-proposition: '<p class="p1">As a University of Mary Washington biology major, you might collect samples on the Rappahannock River one day then contribute to a class discussion on ecology the next. Our biology major goes beyond molecules and microscopes, feeding your curiosity about living things, fostering the scientific process, and challenging you to find fresh approaches to research.</p>'
wpcf-areas-of-study: '<p class="p1">Course offerings include human biology, organism function and diversity, botany, chordate anatomy, plant ecology, animal ecology, entomology, histology, genetics, nutrition and metabolism, microbiology, parasitology, animal behavior, neurobiology, endocrinology, vertebrate zoology, ornithology, virology, biology of cancer, and more.</p>'
wpcf-career-opportunties: '<p class="p1">Biology graduates may find employment in research, health care, environmental conservation, education, biotechnology, forensic science, government and policy, and science publishing, among other fields. Many UMW biology graduates pursue advanced degrees.</p>'
wpcf-internships: '<p class="p1">UMW biology majors may qualify for paid internships through the <a href="http://csiip.spacegrant.org/students">Commonwealth STEM Industry Internship Program</a>. The Department of Biology helps students learn about and apply for internships in the fields of research, medicine, zoology, botany, and ecology. Students also may find internships with museums in the Fredericksburg area or nearby Richmond, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.</p>'

wpcf-testimonial: |
  <div class="quote">The biology program at UMW was the perfect stepping-stone on my way to veterinary school. The professors and other faculty were so encouraging to me and my peers, and having small classes where I could know them personally made that relationship all the more meaningful. I got a solid education and felt very prepared for my entrance into a professional school.</div>
