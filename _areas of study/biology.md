  <div class="quote">The biology program at UMW was the perfect stepping-stone on my way to veterinary school. The professors and other faculty were so encouraging to me and my peers, and having small classes where I could know them personally made that relationship all the more meaningful. I got a solid education and felt very prepared for my entrance into a professional school.</div>
