wpcf-value-proposition: "For you, it's not enough to know that a mountain, ocean, or crater exists. You have to know why the Earth's physical features are where they are, and how they came to be. If you're fascinated by the Earth's physical structures and processes, and you want to do some of your learning outdoors and on location, UMW's geology major may be your niche. Here -- beside the Rappahannock River and just a short drive from the Chesapeake Bay or the Shenandoah Valley -- you'll get one-on-one time with our master teachers, and you'll take a range of courses that will help you find your passion. Our strong liberal arts program will help you develop the critical-thinking, problem-solving, and communications skills you'll need to begin your geology career or pursue an advanced degree."
wpcf-areas-of-study: >
  Geology majors build on the principles
  of chemistry, physics, biology, and
  mathematics in their quest to understand
  our planet. Major course offerings
  include paleontology, oceanography,
  mineralogy, petrology, fluvial
  geomorphology, plate tectonics,
  structural geology, and climate history
  and reorganizations through time.
wpcf-career-opportunties: |
  <a href="http://bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/geoscientists.htm">Job opportunities for geoscientists</a> are increasing, with an expected growth between 2012 and 2022 of 16 percent. In 2012, median pay in the field was $90,890.
  
  Forbes Magazine ranks geology among the most valuable college majors through 2020, based on projected starting salary, mid-career pay, and BLS hiring forecasts.
wpcf-internships: >
  In recent years, UMW geology and other
  environmental sciences majors have
  served internships with the City of
  Fredericksburg, the Army Corps of
  Engineers, the Virginia Department of
  Game and Inland Fisheries, Friends of
  the Rappahannock, Marstel-Day LLC, the
  Chesapeake Climate Action Network,
  Greenpeace, the U.S. Environmental
  Protection Agency, the U.S. Department
  of Agriculture, and more.
wpcf-honors: >
  Students with a 3.0 overall grade-point
  average and a 3.25 average in geology
  courses may pursue honors in geology or
  environmental geology by completing an
  independent research project and writing
  and defending a thesis.
wpcf-major-requirements: 'The <a href="https://catalog.umw.edu/undergraduate/majors/geography/#requirementstext">geology major</a> requires 36 credits including core geology courses and upper-level geology electives. With advisor approval, certain chemistry or environmental sciences classes may count toward the major.'
